# Pocket TTS ONNX

ONNX export of [Pocket TTS](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/pocket-tts) for lightweight text-to-speech with zero-shot voice cloning.

This repository is based on the original implementation at https://github.com/KevinAHM/pocket-tts-onnx-export.

When cloning, be sure to pull submodules as well:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KevinAHM/pocket-tts-onnx-export.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Model Description

Pocket TTS is a compact text-to-speech model from Kyutai that supports voice cloning from short audio samples. This ONNX export provides:

- **Zero-shot voice cloning** from any audio reference
- **INT8 quantized models** for fast CPU inference
- **Streaming support** with adaptive chunking for real-time playback
- **Temperature control** for generation diversity
- **Dual model architecture** for flexible flow matching

## Architecture

This export uses a **dual model split** for the Flow LM:

```
flow_lm_main   - Transformer/conditioner (produces conditioning vectors)
flow_lm_flow   - Flow network only (Euler integration for latent sampling)
```

This architecture enables:
- **Temperature control**: Adjust generation diversity via noise scaling
- **Variable LSD steps**: Trade off speed vs quality
- **External flow loop**: Full control over the sampling process

## Performance

Benchmarked on a 16-core CPU, `lsd_steps=1`, measuring flow loop + mimi decoder (excluding voice encoder).

| Precision                | Flow Main | Flow Net | Decoder | Total Size | RTFx (CPU) |
| ------------------------ | --------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| INT8                     | 76 MB     | 10 MB    | 23 MB   | ~200 MB    | **~4.0x**  |
| FP32                     | 303 MB    | 39 MB    | 42 MB   | ~475 MB    | **~2.8x**  |
| PyTorch FP32 (reference) | —         | —        | —       | —          | ~4.0x      |

RTFx = Real-time factor (>1.0 means faster than real-time). ONNX INT8 matches PyTorch FP32 throughput.

### Optimized Inference

Thread count is automatically tuned to avoid over-subscription on the small sequential matmuls in the autoregressive loop (`intra_op_num_threads=min(cpu_count, 4)`, `inter_op_num_threads=1`). This alone provides a **~2x speedup** over default ORT settings on multi-core machines.

### Decoding Strategy

- **Offline (`generate`)**: Uses **threaded parallel decoding** — the mimi decoder runs in a background thread, decoding 12-frame chunks while the flow loop generates the next frames. This overlaps generation and decoding for maximum throughput.
- **Streaming (`stream`)**: Uses **adaptive chunking** (starts at 2 frames). This ensures instant start (low TTFB) while scaling up chunk sizes for throughput.

## Usage

```python
from pocket_tts_onnx import PocketTTSOnnx

# Load model (INT8 by default)
tts = PocketTTSOnnx()

# Generate speech with voice cloning
audio = tts.generate(
    text="Hello, this is a test of voice cloning.",
    voice="reference_sample.wav"
)

# Save output
tts.save_audio(audio, "output.wav")
```

### Temperature Control

Adjust generation diversity with the `temperature` parameter:

```python
# More deterministic (lower temperature)
tts = PocketTTSOnnx(temperature=0.3)

# Default balance
tts = PocketTTSOnnx(temperature=0.7)

# More diverse/expressive (higher temperature)
tts = PocketTTSOnnx(temperature=1.0)
```

### LSD Steps

Trade off speed vs quality with `lsd_steps`:

```python
# Default (10 steps)
tts = PocketTTSOnnx(lsd_steps=10)

# Faster (fewer steps, lower quality)
tts = PocketTTSOnnx(lsd_steps=1)
```

### Streaming Mode

For real-time applications with low time-to-first-audio:

```python
for chunk in tts.stream("Hello world!", voice="reference_sample.wav"):
    play_audio(chunk)  # Process each chunk as it arrives
```

### Command Line

```bash
uv generate.py "Hello, this is a test." reference_sample.wav output.wav
```
